# Introduction

## What this book is not

The primary purpose of this book is to explain the internal architecture of popcorn2. This is not a replacement for documentation for any public or private kernel APIs. If you are trying to write a kernel module, please refer to the [documentation](https://popcorn-2.github.io/popcorn-2/kernel_api).

## popcorn2

**popcorn2** is a hobby microkernel written by [@egkoppel](https://github.com/egkoppel), as way to experiment with OS design ideas (which he claims are "improvements") not present in the major three OSes.
